		<div class="introduction">
			<h2 class="name">Hi, I'm Megan!</h2>
			<p>For as long as I can remember, I have desired to help people understand new concepts.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What started with me writing brochures, presentations, and marketing material for my high school robotics team grew into organizing media engagement strategies for a Fortune 100 company.</li>
				<li>Inventing small lessons for my younger brother grew into developing full curriculums as volunteer work and lecturing for freshman computer science classes. </li>
				<li>A curiosity for combining programming with communications grew into an interest in website development and me taking graduate-level classes in content management systems (CMS), visual design, and user experience and testing as an undergraduate student. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Basically, I enjoy helping people overcome the barriers of learning new information, especially when it includes a technical focus. </p>

			<p>My college coursework educated me on how to create audience-focused content, design visually and rhetorically appropriate pieces, program user-friendly websites, edit various types of documents, and apply fundamental programming concepts. During the summer, I intern at John Deere, where my four internships taught me project management, content creation, and communication skills. Finally, serving as a teaching assistant for freshman computer science students, organizing and leading workshops for new robotics team coaches, mentoring elementary robotics teams, and writing curriculums for preschoolers taught me to how to create content and instructional material for a variety of audiences.</p>

			<p>Overall, my background in communications, teaching, website development, and programming provides me with the technical, training, and audience analysis skills to work in communication, training, content management, and website development. I hope to have a career where I always make information accessible, engaging, and understandable for all audiences. </p>
