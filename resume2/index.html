		<div class="introduction">
			<h2 class="name">Hi, I'm Megan!</h2>
			<p>For as long as I can remember, I have desired to help people understand new concepts.  As I pursued my undergraduate degree, a graduate-level course in user experience caused me to fall in love with the process of researching audience needs, designing prototypes, and implementing user-focused content.  Now, I am passionate about creating user-focused content by considering rhetoric, computer science, and research theories.</p>

			<p>My ultimate goal is to use my communication, technical, and research skills to work in user experience. I strive to have a career where I make information accessible, engaging, and understandable for all audiences.</p>

			<p>Professionally, I held six internships, five of which were for John Deere and one was for Dawn Foods, where I gained industry experience working on user experience, content creation, instructional design, and software development projects.  For 3½ years, I worked as an undergraduate TA for freshman computer science students, teaching Java and Python.  Now, I teach public speaking in Iowa State’s English department, helping students understand the importance of audience-focused communication.</p>

			<p>I graduated with my undergraduate degree from Iowa State University: a double major in technical and speech communications with minors in computer science and learning technologies.  Now, I am furthering my skillset by pursuing a Master’s degree at Iowa State in Rhetoric, Composition, and Professional Communication, with an emphasis on human-computer interaction.</p>
